# Take a Hike

## Take a Hike

Take a Hike is hiking assitant app where you can find/share/rate trails around you, save favorites to your profile, create lists and follow like minded hikers.

## Background and Overview

Due to the quarantine demand for access to nature and outdoor excursions has greatly risen.  While there are websites that allow you to find hikes in your area, there remains a dearth of resources connecting individual hikers with like minded individuals.  Often times, hikers will arrive at a hike ill prepared and won't enjoy their experience to the fullest.  

Take a Hike aims to alleviate this by creating a platform that connects hikers to each other.  Users will be able to share equipment lists with each other and to review and rate hikes in the area allowing their followers to have a better insight on what to expect.
